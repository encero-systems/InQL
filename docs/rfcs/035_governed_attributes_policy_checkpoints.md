## Summary

This RFC defines how InQL carries governed attributes and records policy checkpoints as local relational evidence. Governed attributes are typed facts attached to semantic targets with provenance, confidence, authority, and lifetime. Policy checkpoints are decision records attached at authoring, planning, binding, or execution boundaries. InQL carries and propagates evidence; it does not define an organization-wide policy engine.

## Motivation

Relational plans often need to carry facts such as classification, origin, purpose, jurisdiction, derivation, masking status, or coverage state. Those facts may be supplied by model metadata, user declarations, imported artifacts, catalogs, policy engines, or prior plans. InQL should preserve and propagate them through relational semantics without pretending that inferred attributes are automatically authoritative policy truth.

## Goals

- Define governed attributes as typed evidence attached to semantic targets.
- Preserve source, confidence, authority, status, observed time, expiration, and evidence references.
- Define policy checkpoint records at authoring, planning, binding, and execution.
- Allow InQL to explain how attributes move through relational transformations.
- Keep policy authoring, approval, and global enforcement outside InQL.

## Non-Goals

- Defining a policy language.
- Defining a global invariant registry.
- Defining approvals, stewardship, ownership, or certification workflow.
- Deciding legal or compliance obligations.
- Making inferred attributes authoritative without review or explicit status.

## Guide-level explanation (how authors think about it)

An inspection may show that an output field carries derived attributes:

```incan
lineage = inspect_lineage(report)
field = lineage.output_field("email_domain")

for attribute in field.governed_attributes():
    print(attribute.key, attribute.status, attribute.confidence)
```

If a policy engine or session binding later allows, masks, warns, or rejects part of the plan, that result appears as a policy checkpoint record attached to the relevant target.

## Reference-level explanation (precise rules)

A governed attribute must include attribute identity, target, key, typed value, scope, source, confidence, status, authority when available, observed time when available, expiration time when available, and evidence references.

Attribute scope must distinguish at least field, relation, expression, plan, output, and execution_path scopes.

Attribute source must distinguish at least model, user, lineage, catalog, policy, adapter, imported artifact, and inferred.

Confidence must distinguish exact, high, medium, low, and unknown or equivalent ordered states.

Status must distinguish asserted, inferred, accepted, rejected, overridden, stale, and pending_review or equivalent review states.

InQL may propagate attributes through relational transformations when transformation semantics are known. It must preserve provenance and confidence. It must report conservative or unknown propagation when exact propagation is not available.

A policy checkpoint record must include decision identity, target, checkpoint, action, policy reference, reason code, evidence references, visibility, and optional diagnostics.

Checkpoint must distinguish authoring, planning, binding, and execution. Action must distinguish at least allow, deny, redact, mask, row_filter, warn, require_quality_check, require_approval, and observe.

Policy checkpoint records are evidence of a decision or external result. They must not by themselves define the policy language that produced the decision.

## Design details

### Syntax

This RFC introduces no policy syntax.

### Semantics

InQL owns attribute carriage, propagation evidence, and checkpoint records. It does not own organizational policy meaning.

### Interaction with other InQL surfaces

Lineage edges explain how attributes may propagate. Adapter requirements may be created when a policy checkpoint requires backend capabilities such as masking or row filtering.

### Compatibility / migration

Existing plans without governed attributes remain valid. Consumers must treat absent attributes, unknown attributes, and rejected attributes as distinct states when those distinctions are available.

## Alternatives considered

- **Make InQL a policy engine.** Rejected because policy authoring and approval are outside typed relational semantics.
- **Use plain metadata tags only.** Rejected because provenance, confidence, authority, and status are required for trustworthy evidence.
- **Drop uncertain attributes.** Rejected because uncertainty is meaningful evidence.

## Drawbacks

- Attribute propagation can be complex and conservative.
- Policy checkpoint records can be mistaken for policy semantics unless docs are clear.
- More lifecycle states increase author and tool complexity.

## Layers affected

- **InQL specification** — governed attribute and checkpoint record semantics become normative.
- **InQL library package** — inspection APIs must expose attributes and decisions as typed records.
- **Execution / interchange** — Session and adapters may attach binding and execution checkpoint records.
- **Documentation** — docs must distinguish attribute evidence from policy authority.

## Unresolved questions

- Which governed attribute keys should InQL reserve for core use?
- Which propagation rules are required for the first release?
- Should policy checkpoints be serializable in portable plan artifacts by default, or only in local evidence artifacts?
